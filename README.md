# Codepen CSS starter

<p>Whenever a new [Codepen](https://www.codepen.com) is created the annoying default settings should be overridden.</p>
<p>(I know there are some settings under the CSS tab but it's not enough. period)</p>
<br/>Just a couple of lines but it could save you some time & from pulling your hair out ðŸ˜±
<br /><br/>
If you need a proper CSS Reset I highly recommend [Josh Comeau's modernized CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
